        <h2>What Is A Treaty?</h2>
        <p>A treaty is an legal agreement between two or more groups that explains what each group has to do and what they have the right to do. Treaties can be made between governments, communities, countries, or any other groups.</p>
        <p>Many treaties where created all across Canada, but only five are inside Manitoba. Treaties 1 to 5 are all apart of Manitoba in some way. Although there are many treaties to study, we will only be covering Treaty 1. First though, we will be briefly explaing each Treaty that is within Manitoba.</p>
