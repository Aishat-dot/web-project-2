    <!--Explaining what Treaty 1 is-->
    <h3>What Is Treaty 1?</h3>
    <p>Treaty 1 is the first treaty created out of many treaties known as the numbered treaties.</p>
    
    <!--Explains when and where Treaty 1 was signed and who was apart of it -->
    <h3>When And Where Treaty 1 Was Signed, And Who Was Apart Of It</h3>
    <p>Treaty 1 was an agreement made between the First Nations of Long Plain, Sagkeeng, Brokenhead Ojibway, Sandy Bay Ojibway, Swan Lake, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinaabe and the Canadian government on Ausgust 3rd, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry.</p>
    <p>Treaty 1 was signed to build a relationship between the Indigenous peoples, and the Canadian government to secure land to settle on while allowing Indigenous communities to have access to their territories with the addition of settlers.</p>
    <p>It served as a way for the Canadian government to confirm their control of the land while trying to peacefully add Indigenous peoples into a new way of life.</p>

    <!--Explains why each side signed the treaty and what parts of Canada were apart of it-->
    <h3>Why Sign The Treaty</h3>
    <p>Indigenous peoples signed the Treaty to protect their traditional lands, and secure some rights as settlers moved onto their territories.</p>
    <p>The Canadian government signed the Treaty to gain access to land for settlement and resources, while creating a more peaceful relationship with Indigenous peoples compared to the struggles in the United States. </p>
    <p>Winnipeg, Brandon, Portage La Prairie, Selkirk, Steinbach, Lundar, Grand Beach, Emerson, Winkler, and many more communities/areas are all under the rules of the Treaty.</p>

    <h3>Treaty 1 Today</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Treaties in Canada are still active today, but throughout history, Treaties have not been followed fully by the state or understood by settlers. 
    Because of that, Indigenous Peoples have been harmed in ways you could never imagine. They have faced discrimination, violence, trauma, and the horror of Residential Schools.</p>
    <a class="sources" href="https://www.rrc.ca/indigenous/2024/08/06/treaty-1-anniversary-august-3-2024/" target="_blank">rrc.ca</a>
    <p>Not long after Treaty 1 was signed, the Indian Act is introduced. The Act aims to remove the culture of First Nations and replace it with Canadian culture.
        Years later, the Act is Amended, and then outlawed the potlatch ceremony, and Tamanawas winter dances of Indigenous Peoples. 
        Today, many amendments have been made to the Indian Act for the better, but there are still problems needing to be addressed.
